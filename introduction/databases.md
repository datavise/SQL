# Databases

A broad definition for a database is 'a computerized container for organized data'. This definition includes spreadsheets or plain text files such as XML or CSV.



Usually, however, when talking about a database, people usually mean relational database management systems or RDBMS.



**Relational Databases**

A database contains one or more tables, which should be familiar if you've ever created a sheet in a spreadsheet.

Each table has a row for each record and rows, in turn, are split into fields.
