# ORDER BY

A query with an ORDER BY statement will have its results ordered. By default, results will be ordered from lowest to highest or ascending (ASC).&#x20;



`SELECT budget, title`&#x20;

`FROM Movies`&#x20;

`ORDER BY budget`



To have the results ordered from highest to lowest, use the DESC keyword:

`SELECT budget, title`&#x20;

`FROM Movies`&#x20;

`ORDER BY budget DESC`
